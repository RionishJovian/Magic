/**
 * Canonical `app_role` string literals — keep DB and app in sync.
 *
 * `primary` — Application owner / producer (formerly `owner`); does not own a café.
 * `client` (User) — café shop owner running their own RouterBOARD Hotspot business.
 * `agent` (Verified Agent) — hired by the Application owner to recruit café Users;
 *   Magic Coins commission on monthly/annual purchases from referred Users.
 * Developer (`platform_admins`) builds features and also does not own a café.
 *
 * `user_roles.owner_id` records direct parentage; operational data remains
 * self-scoped through `effective_owner()` for client and agent accounts.
 * Verified Agent referrals use `account_referrals.agent_id` for Magic Coins
 * (recruitment attribution — not café ownership).
